## Notable Obstacles

Video Codecs
- Struggled to keep Video Codecs consistent, it slows down the CLI prototype significantly.
- Does not matter what container the video is in.

Noise Parameters
- Difficult to find the right threshold of noise to make it visibly graining, or make image not too noisy.
- Need to find a way to search for all and experiment all parameters.

Implementing "Realistic Film Grain"
- Implementation based from C++ implementation and is very difficult to understand
- Just need to read more and understand it, ask for external help
